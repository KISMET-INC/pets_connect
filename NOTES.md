# Project Challenges
## Problem:  
[ 12/10/2020 ] Trouble creating a smooth interface when comments are added inside of modal
## Solution:
- Added a number to the URL route 
- Checked if URL route is not zero implying an active image is available
- Targeted that modal in the dom using the url and loaded even before page load to bypass reload flash


# Wish I Had Done Differently
- Mapped out the responsive wireframe design before building the project
  - It proved difficult to make responsive after architeture is already built without responsiveness in mind
